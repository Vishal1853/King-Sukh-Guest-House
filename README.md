# üè® King Sukh Guest House Website  

The **King Sukh Guest House Website** is a fully responsive and modern web project designed to provide visitors with a smooth and professional experience when exploring the property online. Built with HTML5, CSS3, and a touch of JavaScript for interactivity, the website reflects a clean dark-themed design enhanced with gradients, soft shadows, and subtle animations for a premium look.  

The site includes all essential sections for a guest house: a **hero section** introducing the property, an **amenities section** showcasing the comforts offered, a **room listing** with transparent pricing, a **gallery** to preview the property, and a **testimonial section** to display guest feedback. Additionally, it integrates a **location map** for easy navigation and a **contact section** with full booking details.  

A highlight of the project is the **Booking System**, powered by PHP and MySQL. Guests can fill in their booking information‚Äîincluding name, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, room type, and special requests. On submission, data is stored securely in a MySQL database through a PHP script running on a local XAMPP server. This ensures that inquiries are recorded systematically and can be managed by the guest house staff.  

The project is structured for both static front-end display and dynamic back-end functionality. Visitors browsing online will experience the responsive and animated design, while local deployments with XAMPP enable full booking functionality. This makes the project a great example of combining **UI/UX design** principles with **basic server-side development**.  

Future improvements include adding an admin dashboard for viewing reservations, automated email confirmations for bookings, and payment gateway integration. Overall, the website is designed to be lightweight, fast, and user-friendly, while giving potential guests a professional first impression of King Sukh Guest House.
